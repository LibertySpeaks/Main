#### Jew-Gentile review and where we are today.

So we got natural selection selecting for order and eventually the very mechanisms like genetics and 'the market process' which create the biological and socioeconomic orders respectively. The latter inadvertently arose as homo sapiens respected private property more and more, which encouraged more pie-and-order-increasing-trade as opposed to violence, which turned brains into CPUs in a global world-wide distributed supercomputer which is constantly innovating and spreading information via 'economic competition'. The 'software', in other words, the identities-culture-laws that homo sapiens absorbed leading to this chain-reaction of freedom and emerging 'competitive knowledge discovery' and thus civilization got a massive boost when things like monotheism and 'The Ten Commandments' arose. As already briefly discussed, 'Jewish Identity' has *inadvertently* helped civilization via pro-freedom-capitalism attitudes-myths, the defense of the freedom of minorities and individuals since they are understandably usually a minority. But, again, as Churchill so wisely noticed, they have also *inadvertently* spread disastrous myths like Communism and Zionism leading to polarizations that led to World War Two and now the Russia-Ukraine World War. We need a Zionist Gorbachev asap that can somewhat admit to error and help bring reform. The Muslim world also needs a Gorbachev, one that can significantly change the tone of its general criticism of Zionism to be one without conspiratorial malice and more based on understandable errors. 

One of the few relatively wise mainstream voices critisizing the accelerating collapse of the USA via both the CovidMania coercive 'Priesthood of Scientism', as well as the Zionized 'Foreign Policy Priesthood' pushing for the tribalistic Neocon Russia-Ukraine war was Fox news political commentator Tucker Carlson who was abruptly "cancelled" or "deplatformed" in April 2023. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League and thus the ideal representative of today's 'Jewish Identity' tweeted:

<img src="../../images/greenblatt-tucker.jpg" alt="Greenblatt on Tucker"
	title="Greenblatt on Tucker" width="550" height="200" />

Nevermind that Carlson is a fellow homo sapiens, has a degree in History, has read countless books, is a father and family man, has educated millions via his journalism. Nah, he spewes 'antisemitic, racist, xenophobic and anti-LGBTQ hate to millions.'

Unfortunately Tucker himself and much of America lacks the necessary nuanced understanding needed to really make sense of the world and understandably falls for the usual 'good vs. evil' arguments, blaming our increasing chaos on "some larger force acting upon us", which sadly some will blame on a 'conspiracy by Jews' given the understandable misunderstandings and resulting emnity as Greenblatt's comments clearly show. Turcker mentions in one of his last speeches before being laid off:

>"....none of this makes sense in conventional political terms. When people or crowds of people or the largest crowd of people at all which is the federal government the largest human organization in human history decide that the goal is to destroy things. Destruction for its own sake...What you're watching is not a political movement, it's evil..... if you want to know what's evil and what's good what are the characteristics of those....Good is characterized by order, calmness, tranquility, peace, whatever you want to call it, lack of conflict...And evil is characterized by their opposites, violence, hate, disorder, division, disorganization and filth, so if you are all in on the things that produce the latter basket of outcomes, what you're really advocating for is evil. That's just true. I'm not calling for a religious war, far from it, I'm merely calling for an acknowledgment of what we're watching..... Let's have a debate about our ideas, they don't want a debate... Those are manifestations of some larger force acting upon us, it's just so obvious, [it's completely obvious."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32UPXGChgo)


Regarding the Zionist-Neocons, who continue to polarize the planet in their quixotic fight against antisemitism, the great Ron Paul who has a superb laser-like focus on how the Zionist-Neocons spread their dangerous ideology and wars mentions: 

>"...a lot of them don't seem to be totally evil... I think a lot of them are very naive and well intentioned....but the people who really run the show, you know, the Paul Wolfowitzs of the world, the Neocon leaders...like a Dick Chaney...[I think they're evil."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY9EXX-fP98)

Ouch! No! "They" are NOT evil! They are fellow homo sapiens in their culturally evolved 'echo chambers' following their ideologies and myths. In an interview with Iran TV Ron Paul mentioned:

"....the tragedy of Gaza.... To me I look at it like a concentration camp. And people are making home-made bombs, and [like] they are the agressors?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1t4O9CcZQ0)

Ouch! Gaza can easily be seen by one side as a 'concentration camp' but this view implies that a moral choice between who is good (Palestinians and Hamas who make the bombs) and bad (Israelis who create the 'concentration camp') has been made when in reality moral judgements are not the way to untangle the complex evolutionary factors that have us where we are. Again, it does not matter how horrible the actions of fellow homo sapiens may be, we have to focus on the complex ideas and circumstances that lead them to act the way they do.

Unfortunately, and yet again for reasons no one is to blame, just like the traumatized Jews see antisemitism everywhere and with immense understandable ignorance, negligence and often-times viciosuly and cruelly leave immense destruction and missery on their wake, many in Gaza are also traumatized and have an immense hatred of Jews and fall for all the naive antisemitic tropes which then of course motivates the Zionists-Jews and their supporters to see the world the way they do and the chicken came before the egg etc. What a mess! In websites like 'Palestinian Media Watch'[(palwatch.org)](https://palwatch.org/) Jews constantly monitor the seemingly never-ending stream of hate towards Jews that one finds in Palestinian media. Just one quick look with some recent headlines shows:

>"Mahmoud Al-Tamimi, father of 19-year-old terrorist “Martyr”:  
>“Qusai completed the matriculation exams last year [2021], and he worked for some time in a restaurant in Ramallah. He was beloved in the village, and he never aspired to have a car or to have a home, or to prepare himself for the future. He aspired to Martyrdom, and indeed he achieved it.” 

>[Official PA daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Oct. 26, 2022] "

Videos like this one ['The Child-Martyrdom cult of the Palestinian Authority'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3-zENpAF-U) show clips from Palestinian TV showing kids being raised for martyrdom saying awful things, etc. The fellow homo sapiens who have absorbed a 'Jewish Identity' watch this and it is obvious to them that they are good and these people are evil, and thus as with Communist fallacies, the naive ideas and inevitable polarizations spread, providing the subtle but powerful swimmer's kick that inadvertently and “indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design” keeps polarizing mankind towards the final calamity. 

To the current crop of economically ignorant American and European ideological leaders, the current atheistic 'Priesthood of Scientism', and the increasing millions of government-connected corporations and socialist-minded-do-gooders, the views of Christians like Tucker and Paul talking about "evil" are as enthusiastically discarded as they were in 1918 by Lenin and his "experts". The patterns just repeat. And remember the great Charles Lindbergh? We re-quote:   

>"It is not difficult to understand why Jewish people desire the overthrow of Nazi Germany. The persecution they suffered in Germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race. No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution of the Jewish race in Germany. But no person of honesty and vision can look on their pro-war policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy both for us and for them. Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way for they will be among the first to feel its consequences."

Again, can you see the pattern repeat? Tucker, by arguing for peace and away from the tribalistic march to World War, is simply a traitor to 'the forces of good' trying to eradicate 'the forces of evil'. Soon after Turcker's firing, a senior Department of Defense official mentioned: “We’re a better country without him bagging on our military every night in front of hundreds of thousands of [people,”](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/25/pentagon-officials-cheer-tucker-carlson-ouster-00093819) . The simplistic-tribalistic with-us-or-against-us just intensifies.

Again, Mises tells us:

>"History speaks only to those people who know how to interpret it on the ground of correct theories."

Thus without the wisdom of Menger and his descendants, the emergence of our history and workings of the present remain relatively unknown as we march towards the final calamity. 

The mainstream 'Political Left' treats the Zionists as malicious white settler colonialists and capitalist exploiters which is a naive monumental error. Although movements like Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) have brought some much needed attention to the Palestinians, the vilifying character of the movement is mistaken and does immense harm. Again, as with Communism, communist ideologues were not malicous or "evil" even if some very bad apples could easily be found in the massive coercive bureucracies. One has to understand and sympathise with how the Zionists (also Communists) fooled themselves, oftentiems with the best intentions, into their respective myths, without vilification! Our previous Mises quote applies here again :

>"The problems involved are purely intellectual and must be dealt with as such. It is disastrous to shift them to the moral sphere and to dispose of supporters of opposite ideologies by calling them villains. It is vain to insist that what we are aiming at is good and what our adversaries want is bad. The question to be solved is precisely what is to be considered as good and what as bad. The rigid dogmatism peculiar to religious groups and to Marxism results only in irreconcilable conflict. It condemns beforehand all dissenters as evildoers, it calls into question their good faith, it asks them to surrender unconditionally. No social cooperation is possible where such an attitude prevails."

The constant moral pontification-vilification is doing immense harm! We need a careful and blame-free analysis of the situation and a solution.

Then there are tons of naive 'antisemites' accusing 'the Jews' of 'plotting' all kinds of things. It is actually the intellectual errors of the naive antisemites which then gives immense support to the Jews-Zionists. The reason why Jews in America who are just 2.3% of the population, and in Europe where they are just 0.2%, have so much influence and "power", has little to do with some 'sinister conspiracy' but with the understandable immense sympathy they get from the masses reacting to the naive antisemites. Again, this is what pushed them towards war with Hitler, and is again *inadvertently* taking them towards war with Putin. 

At the United Nations various hordes of apes just vilify each other, constantly accusing each other of 'committing war crimes', of 'violating human rights'. Again, for the 345th time, there is no one to blame for these misunderstandings and resulting tribalisms.
