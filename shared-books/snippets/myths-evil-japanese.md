##### The "Evil" Japanese who bombed Pearl Harbor


On December 7, 1941 the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor which officially brought the USA into World War Two. A few months later on March 30th, 1942 US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had thousands of Japanese Americans quickly gathered and sent to concentration camps.

Via their treaty obligations with the Japanese, Germany also declared war on the U.S. By this time the U.S. had been in a non-shooting war against Germany for a while by giving financial and material support to England and the Soviet Union and much more. As Roosevelt had told Churchill “I shall never declare war; I shall make war. If I were to ask Congress to declare war they might argue about it for three months.” The attack on Pearl Harbor was the inevitable and in many ways welcomed and precipitated result of the Roosevelt administration’s efforts to bring the U.S. fully into the war. For example, according to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, on a meeting on November 25th 1941, President Roosevelt:

>“…brought up the event that we were likely to be attacked perhaps (as soon as) next Monday, for the Japanese are notorious for making an attack without warning, and the question was what we should do. The question was how we should maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.”

Why would Japan do this? The usual slightly smarter ape tribalistic thinking would paint the Japanese as some irrational militaristic race of evil brutal conquerors which had to be stopped by the forces of good (Roosevelt-America). But any rational person with a basic understanding of biology and history knows that the Japanese were fellow homo sapiens, that there is no such thing as "evil", and that such a group of people who reached such heights in terms of scientific and cultural achievements would not attack Pearl Harbor without significant provocation. Some Japanese, just like the British, French, Germans and other “white” people, wanted to have their own colonies for misguided economic reasons and play a role in shaping their corner of the world. And also, very importantly, they wanted to somehow prevent the spread of Soviet Communism, which thanks to the Soviet Union’s great size and China’s relative backwardness and rule by various war-lords, was spreading throughout the region. According to the great Pulitzer Prize-winning historian John Toland, Yosuke Matsuoka, Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs (1940-41):

>“declared that Japan was fighting for two goals: to prevent Asia from falling completely under the white man’s domination, as in Africa, and to save China from Communism. “No treasure trove is in here eyes—only sacrifices upon sacrifices. No one realizes this more than she does. But her very life depends on it, as do those of her neighbors as well. The all absorbing question before Japan today…is: “Can she bear the cross?”” (Toland, 2003)

According to U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew:

>“Japan considers herself as the bulwark against the spread of Communism southward and eastward. Given sufficient provocation, the Japanese could readily be aroused to enter Siberia with the intention of completely destroying a regime which it fears and detests.”

At the end of World War One the winning powers agreed to let Japan maintain an army in Northern China (Manchuria) primarily to protect the Southern Manchurian Railway. Toland again writes that Japan:

>“poured a billion dollars into the bandit-infested, sparsely populated territory, and maintained such law and order along the railroads that hundreds of thousands of Japanese, Chinese and Korean traders and settlers flooded into the area. It was this mass influx that had inspired Ishihara and Itagaki[Japanese Generals] to envision a Manchuria free of its Chinese war-lord ruler. Ishihara dreamed of making it an autonomous state, a heaven for all of its ethnic groups—Japanese, Chinese, Manchurians, Koreans and White Russians.” (Toland, 2003, p. 7)

Ishihara and Itagaki, without approval from higher-ups in the army took it upon themselves to issue orders to quickly take over Manchuria.  In 1932 the Japanese setup a pro-Japanese government headed by the Chinese Qing dynasty emperor Puyi and thus created the state of Manchukuo. Thanks to Japanese investment and oversight, besides Japan, Manchukuo became the most economically prosperous area in the Far East. Kishi Nobusuke, who had once had a top administrative position in Manchukuo and later became prime minister of Japan after World War Two noted in a memoir that, in the establishment of Manchukuo:

>“the ideals of ethnic harmony and peace and prosperity shone radiantly. A scientific, conscientious, bold experiment was carried out there. This was a truly unique modern state formation. The people directly involved devoted their energies to it motivated by their sincere aspirations, and also the peoples of Japan and Manzhouguo strongly supported it; and Mohandas Gandhi, the Indian holy man, offered encouragement from far away. At the time Manzhouguo was the hope of East Asia.” 

Today Pearl Harbor is in the U.S. State of Hawaii, yet at the time Hawaii was not even a U.S. state, and over time it became one against the wishes of its native population. I am sure many native Chinese detested the puppet Puyi administration just like many native Hawaiians detested the overthrow of their Queen Lili'uokalani. In 1993 the Clinton administration issued a formal apology admitting that the U.S. had annexed Hawaii unlawfully. I am not making these points to justify what was undoubtedly Japanese aggression in the establishment of Manchukuo, we just want to see the Japanese ideologues at the time similarly to how we see ours and not as the ‘brutal race of militaristic and evil conquerors’ bullshit that clouds-prevents our understanding of history and ultimately allowed for the wanton murdering of the Japanese in the war that ensued.

On July 26th 1941, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt froze all Japanese assets in U.S. banks (massive theft) and outlawed all exports by U.S. companies to Japan. Japan would purchase about 80% of its oil from U.S. firms like Standard Oil, and now FDR was making it a criminal act for these firms to do business with Japan.  On November 26th the U.S. essentially told Japan that in order to remedy the situation, Japan would have to completely withdraw from China and Indochina among other things, thus essentially giving up control of the areas to various corrupt warlords, and a bunch of Commuinst revolutionaries. As the Stimson quote shows, FDR was well aware that Japan would now strike soon. The U.S. was able to intercept Japanese secret communications and knew of the impending Japanese attack. On December 4th Captain L.F. Safford, chief of Navy Communications Intelligence reported the interception of the “winds execute” message and that “it meant war—and we knew it meant war” (Barnes, 1953)  As Captain Oliver Lyttelton, British Minister of Supplies mentioned on June 20th 1944 “America provoked Japan to such an extent that the Japanese were forced to attack Perl Harbor. It is a travesty on history to say that America was forced into war.”  (Barnes, 1953) As we all know, the war came, Japan was utterly destroyed and nuked twice, civil war and Communism completely engulfed China leading to unimaginable misery.

On August 6th and 9th, 1945 the nuclear bombs were dropped for political reasons that had nothing to do with saving American lives (not that this would have justified dropping the bombs anyways). The myth that the Japanese were some mindless ideologues that just would not surrender evolved to justify this tribalistic calamity. Months before the bombs were dropped the Japanese had been trying to negotiate surrender in a way where they could keep their emperor, who according to their religion was a holy figure. Future president Dwight D. Eisenhower knew this and thus opposed the bomb, he said “First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.”

As historian John V. Denson writes:

>“Since President Truman, in effect, accepted the conditional surrender offered by the Japanese as early as May of 1945, the question is posed, “Why then were the bombs dropped?””

Long before the bombs were dropped, Japan had already been completely devastated by our B-29 bombers. For example, on the single day of March 9, 1945, 279 B-29s incinerated Tokyo killing over 185,000 Japanese. Mostly women and children for sure, at a cost of only 14 US planes.

Our elected ideologues during the time wanted to intimidate the Russians by showing off their new weapon, justify their expenditures on the research to Congress, and another factor was the good’ol tribalism that makes us look at our human enemy as subhuman beasts. As president Truman mentions in a letter to Samuel McCrea Cavert, General Secretary of The Churches of Christ in America, “The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When you have to deal with a beast you have to treat him as a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true.”

Bottom line, only massive hordes of economically ignorant and thus "uncivilized" slightly smarter apes, sadly most Americans at the time, could fool themselves into going along with such slaughter. 

On Dec. 8th, the day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the slightly smarter apes that has absorbed an 'American' identity declared war on the Japanese. Obvioulsy the homo sapiens residing in the US had to salughter the homo sapiens in Japan. Only one truly wise and civilized homo sapiens knew this was an unnecessary bad idea, Jeannette Rankin. She had also gotten it right by voting against US entry into World War One.
