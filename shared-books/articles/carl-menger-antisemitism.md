Understanding The Intellectual Errors Leading to Antisemitism and Resulting Wars: How The Wisdom Of ‘The Austrian School’ Economists Is Needed To Understand The Evolution and Functioning Of Society, And Overcome The Jew-Gentile Misunderstandings That Led To ‘Antisemitism’, Zionism, World War Two, The Russia-Ukraine War, And More.


Carl Menger (1840–1921) and his ‘Austrian School of Economics’ are not only vital for understanding how the socioeconomic order works and has evolved, but also for understanding antisemitism and its disastrous ramifications.

The world is once again dealing with erroneous Jewish conspiratorial thinking as highlighted by Kanye West’s recent misguided remarks about Jews. Few object to studying Judaism and its complex co-evolution with other faiths and Western Civilization. What really turns study, comments, or even criticisms of Judaism into antisemitism is the monumental error of mistaking Jewish influence resulting from complex evolutionary factors, for the result of nefarious conspiracies as is sadly and understandably the characteristic mark of antisemites. This mistake of attributing to conspiracy or human reason, what is more the result of complex evolutionary processes, is an intellectual error that is the root, not just of antisemitism, but of our socioeconomic problems and things like the rise of Socialism-Communism-Nazism during the 20th century. And more generally, why mankind is so tribalistic and economically ignorant. And their proper understanding depends on the evolutionary insights of Carl Menger and his so-called ‘Austrian School of Economics’ and men like Ludwig von Mises and 1974 Nobel Laureate in Economics F.A. Hayek. How can relatively unknown economists hold the key to economic prosperity and overcoming antisemitism? Please just bear with me for about 20 minutes.

Language, which is obviously a vital mechanism for communication and even thought, is, to borrow the popular phrase from Adam Ferguson(1723–1816), “indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design”. Not understanding how language arose via an evolutionary process, myths like the Tower of Babel emerged to placate the curiosity of homo sapiens. Thanks to the likes of Darwin and modern genetics we now understand how the human body-organism and the numerous “systems” that coordinate it like the respiratory-nervous-digestive “systems”, are, as Ferguson may say if he were alive today “indeed the result of actions of cells, but not the execution of cells’ designs” and we understand how an evolutionary process was the inadvertent “designer” of such systems and complex order. Similarly, the modern global socioeconomic order or what the great British 19th century thinker Herbert Spencer(1820–1903) cleverly referred to as “The Social Organism”, is also coordinated by a “system”, by what Carl Menger’s intellectual descendants Mises and Hayek, referred to as “The Market Process”. ‘The Market Process’ and the “parts” it is composed of like money, prices, economic competition, interest rates, and the legal-religious-governmental frameworks that sustain it, “are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design” similar to how cells inadvertently-unconsciously act to create the systems that coordinate multicellular life. And lastly, as we will discuss later, the evolution of culture and our religions which includes Jew-Gentile misunderstandings and thus antisemitism, is also the result of an evolutionary process. Let us first discuss how the socioeconomic order actually works and has evolved in an evolutionary manner which will then make it easier to understand the evolution of antisemitism.

If one understands how information coordinates the biological and social orders, then one understands how the world works. Processes of selective evolution or ‘natural selection’ in general can be said to have created two mechanisms for creating two types of orders, biological and social. The biological order is created via the well-known mechanism of ‘biological evolution’ with genes being like the sentences which store the information necessary to create-coordinate life-order. Mutations cause new genes and thus new information to arise which leads to a different life-form which is then ‘naturally selected’ as it inadvertently competes with others, with the winner reproducing more and thus passing on more copies of the better-adapted-fitter-genes-information-design to future generations.

In the ‘Social Organism’-economy superior information arises and spreads thanks to ‘economic competition’ which emerges from the tradition of private property. Private property means that wealth is under the exclusive control or ownership of a single person-mind-CPU. Each person is motivated to discover the best information with which to transform or reorder their private property in a way that increases its value or utility. Most of us transform the trillions of atoms that make up our bodies in a manner that maximizes the value-utility of the labor we produce and then trade with other people or companies. Some transform bread and beef to increase their value as hamburgers which are then traded with others, etc. From our freedom to use-transform our private property emerges the ‘freedom to trade’ it with anyone in the entire planet which inadvertently transforms mankind into a global supercomputer where people via the companies they create are motivated to innovate and learn from each other(competitors) thus inadvertently cooperate to discover and spread superior information and subsequent order. For example, a Honda engineer in Tokyo, Japan, may have invented power doorlocks which thanks to ‘economic competition’ motivated BMW, Ford, and other ‘competitors’ throughout the world to copy and thus spread superior information throughout the world. Why do they do this? Because people in their role as consumers have the ‘freedom to trade’ their life-order-sustaining wealth with the better informed auto-manufacturers(competitors), and as producers, to go into the auto manufacturing business. This in turn motivates all competitors to learn-copy each other lest they not get enough revenue-wealth with which to pay their employees a competitive wage so they use their ‘freedom to trade’ their labor to join the better-informed and thus more productive-efficient orders-companies. Again, this wonderful automatic mechanism of COMPETITIVE KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY is “turned on” or “emerges” from the simple concept, or better said, tradition of ‘private property’. Just like in the Olympics we can discover the best athletes in the world due to global competition, so does having the ‘freedom to trade’ with everyone in the world allows the best ideas to compete and spread globally thus ensuring the best possible global order. As cost-cutting ideas emerge and inevitably spread via competition leading prices to continuously fall, new profitable ideas easily arise and once again spread via competition in an endless cycle of knowledge generation-innovation. For example, computers were once very expensive, but once the price of making them came down enough, people easily realized that every home could have them, which gave birth to our computerized world and the Internet and all the great things that flow from it. The more wealth is produced, the more wealth has to be offered in exchange for labor as companies-orders compete against each other for the labor they need which helps explain why the economic pie grows for everyone. For example, imagine that after a shipwreck you end up in an island where everyone has a machine that can turn dirt into food. Tom wants your labor to build a home, Mark, to build a boat, and Gina to plant a garden. Competition will motivate them to offer you all the food you want and more.

Morals are simply ways of acting or information which also emerges and spreads via economic competition. It is hard-working, tolerant, courteous people who thanks to competition inevitably motivate everyone else to be likewise. As Hayek writes:

“Competition is, after all, always a process in which a small number makes it necessary for larger numbers to do what they do not like, be it to work harder, to change habits, or to devote a degree of attention, continuous application, or regularity to their work which without competition would not be needed.”

As millions of Britons, Germans, Jews and others from all over the world came to America, it was ultimately the competition which grows from ‘private property’ and thus individual liberty and freedom which stripped these people of their otherwise nationalistic-ethnocentric-tribalistic identities and evolved what came to be seen as the classic American character-ethos of wanting to be seen as a reputable-honest businessman-professional who treats everyone with respect and wears a business suit as opposed to older religious-ethnocentric dress.

The role of governments or coercion should be minimized because governmental or ‘public sector’ bureaucracies, being COERCIVE MONOPOLIES which get their life or order-sustaining wealth through taxes-compulsion are immune to the competitive-information-spreading incentives-pressures which motivate private sector entities to keep up with the competition in terms of information and hustle. Central-government plans can’t work if people are free to not go along with them so they inevitably require compulsion-tyranny. The former Soviet Union had plenty of highly educated scientists-“experts” whose plans required the coercion of millions, but they were thoroughly crushed by relatively freer Americans and their resulting superior “competitive knowledge discovery”. The “classic” image below helps explain the difference between competitive-private-free orders(South Korea) and monopolistic-government-coerced orders (North Korea). Keep your eye on how information arises-spreads via competition and continuously restructures the social order as people trade-exchange-move-reorder property-wealth in a manner where more wealth is produced than consumed thus being profitable and thus increasing the economic pie and socioeconomic order.


Government regulations are just top-down-monopolistic-competition-immune information which then paralyzes-retards ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ driving up costs (more lawyers/regulators/bureaucrats). Compare the increasingly regulated/paralyzed healthcare sector which has grown from consuming less than 5% of the economic pie in 1960 to over 20% today, to the free/competitive IT sector where even the poorest of Americans can afford rapidly improving amazing cell phones and technology. What a person must learn in order to legally offer medical advice via licensing of doctors, where he must learn it via licensing of medical schools, what chemical compounds can be legally consumed, how to test drugs, how the medical insurance industry should work, and countless other gigantic bodies of knowledge/information are dictated by monopolistic competition-less bureaucracies like the American Medical Association (AMA), the Food And Drug Administration (FDA), CDC and numerous others leading to the spectacular CovidMania tyranny. By comparison, the Information Technology sector has very few government regulations so competition motivates the discovery and spread of superior information at breakneck speed and is obviously transforming the world right before our eyes.

Let us now briefly discuss how the above mechanism of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ which creates and spreads the information which coordinates and expands ‘The Social Organism’, like language, arose inadvertently without man’s design. Knowing that ‘private property’ is the simple tradition that leads to a chain-reaction of incentives which leads to the ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ that creates and expands civilization, we can easily see that those cultures whose customs-religions-myths inadvertently became more peaceful and thus less violent, extended peace-friendship-trade to those outside the tribe, etc., in other words, those who tended to respect ‘private property’ and thus individual freedom more and more, would inadvertently gain the emerging benefits of superior ‘competitive knowledge discovery’, become more advanced-powerful, and as they grew, they would inadvertently spread the very customs and evolving economic system (capitalism) that allowed them to reach such relative heights. Essentially 100,000 years ago there was a sort of petri dish of cultures, and ‘natural selection’-competition selected those whose sort of ‘cultural mutations’ led to a more productive-fitter-powerful social order, with respect for private property and thus individual freedom ultimately being the most important tradition given the ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ that inadvertently emerged from it. This is why as freedom and individual rights have increased, so has the social organism.

A good example of this process was the Protestant Reformation. For centuries the Catholic Church’s traditions-myths held immense coercive-monopoly-competitionless power which prevented-retarded individual freedom and resulting ‘competitive knowledge discovery’. In the early 1500s Martin Luther preached that a person could go to heaven by believing in Christ without the Catholic Church’s approval, and that the Bible itself, not the Pope-Church’s edicts-interpretations, was what mattered. This helped reduce the coercive-monopoly power of the Church and spark a pro-freedom and thus emergent ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ that would lead to skyrocketing rates of innovation-production-prosperity in Europe-Christendom thus taking Europeans to prominence. Now, very important! Did Martin Luther “reason” that his religious interpretations would accelerate ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ leading to our relatively advanced civilization? Of course not! Again, just like solitary cells millions of years ago inadvertently created the respiratory-circulatory-nervous-etc. “systems” that led to multicellular organisms without ‘designing them’, so is ‘the free market’ or Capitalism “indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design”.

By the late 1800s, not understanding how the bewildering complexity of modern cities “emerges” from ‘private property’-freedom since this amazing mechanisms-order had been designed, not by clever men, but by an evolutionary process few really understand at the time, homo sapiens fell for Socialist-Communist mythology believing that coercive-competition-immune-bureaucracies led by “experts” was needed to improve society. Eventually someone would describe these increasingly popular fallacies-myths in a manner that was bound to go viral and that is what happened with Karl Marx and his bite-sized ‘Communist Manifesto’(48 pages) where he summarizes:

“the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property”….”Abolition of the family!”

The slightly smarter apes via Vladimir Lenin’s Bolshevik revolution in Russia (1918) and others throughout the world (Mao-China, Castro-Cuba, Pol Pot-Cambodia) with the utmost arrogance and cruelty went wild using their “reason” or “the science”(as we call it today) and instincts to create massive central-planning-coercive bureaucracies that destroyed ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ and thus their own socioeconomic order that had been created by it.

Notice how all man-made calamities, from religious slaughters, to world wars, to political chaos, are always the result of large groups of homo sapiens somehow coercing each other via government. We have simply not evolved to understand the economic forces that create civilization, the vital need for freedom and privatization, and the immense harm that too much government can do. Supposedly the Dodo bird quickly went extinct because it had not evolved to recognize humans as potential dangers, we similarly just line up for ‘central planning’ and government coordinated self-destruction over and over and over and over.

Referring to man’s general economic ignorance Hayek writes:

“To them the market economy is largely incomprehensible…and its results seem to them irrational and immoral. They often see in it merely an arbitrary structure maintained by some sinister power.”

Who is that ‘sinister power’? Each group of economically ignorant homo sapiens depending on their history and numerous circumstances mistakenly identifies a different boogeyman. Since the recent and rapid evolution of the free-market-Capitalism occurred in Europe, understandably so for much of the third world and non-whites, it is “the white man” and his “exploitative Capitalism” and-or “racism”. There is of course, the “evil corporations”, “the rich-CEOs”, “greed”, “sexism”, “minorities”, “immigrants”, etc. It is as if we are fooled into believing that just because the social order is the result of human action, that our problems are likewise the result of conscious planning or plotting by fellow slightly smarter apes. They are not. They are overwhelmingly the result of economic ignorance and the order-destroying central planning bureaucracies the human dodos create. Next we deal with one group of people where once again economic ignorance leads to their being mistaken as some “sinister power” with disastrous world-wide consequences. The Jews. Let’s see how the above insights are needed to understand the never-ending antisemitism and emerging Jew-Gentile calamities like WWII, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the Russia-Ukraine war.

We have to cut a few corners and fast forward from about 100,000 years ago, where there were thousands of little tribes and their respective cultures-software-“identities”, to about 2,000 years ago when some of these groups were being integrated-absorbed into growing empires. So we got Jews, one of these many ethnocentric groups-”identities”, then a Jew by the name of Jesus says he is the son of God and a sort of cultural mutation of Judaism in the form of Christianity emerges. Christian culture-software-identity lost the ethnocentrism that Judaism contains (generally speaking your mother has to be Jewish) which encouraged members to proselytize and rapidly grow in numbers, spreading the great-viral-simple “Ten Commandments”, winning converts who are not supposed to kill each other thus trade relatively peacefully, inadvertently helping spread more freedom and emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’. If we look at Christianity, some of its rules which differed from what was more mainstream at the time and inadvertently led to its growth were things like the prohibition of infanticide, condemnation of divorce, incest, marital infidelity and polygamy. In the Greco-Roman world where Christianity emerged, infanticide, especially of girls, was a common and accepted practice leading to populations of more males than females. For example, there were 131 males per 100 females in the city of Rome, and 140 males per 100 females in Italy, Asia Minor, and North Africa. The prohibition of infanticide would help Christian populations grow faster. These values-rules coupled with the relatively higher status afforded to women made this new religious movement much more appealing to women who would often times convert their husbands thus helping the religion and its values spread. Now! Very important! Did early Christian theologians “reason” that such values would play a significant role in the growth of Christianity and its success? Did they plan this? I doubt it. Again, these things “are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design”.

Remaining an inevitably smaller ethnocentric ideology led to the history of ill treatment Jews have experienced at the hands of the larger Christianity and Islam. Unfortunate, but what can we do, we are slightly smarter apes after all. The best we can hope for is to become “civilized” slightly smarter apes, which we do by understanding what leads to civilization, private property, intellectual freedom and the selection of superior information-TRUTH and order that emerges from it.

The classic and perhaps most important example of the co-evolution of the economy and culture can be seen with the emergence of modern banking-finance. Finance, banking, and interest rates are other vital aspects of the ‘Market Process’ and emerging Social Organism. Besides the more obvious function of safeguarding savings and pooling the savings of many people to allow the execution of bigger projects which would have been impossible if entrepreneurs were limited to the few savings-wealth of friends and family, banking-finance and more specifically the phenomenon of ‘interest rates’ also play a nearly miraculous role. Thanks to finance and banking people are motivated to save and thus refrain from consumption thus leaving more wealth available for borrowers who then get to consume this wealth as they grow the economic pie by an amount that has to be greater than prevailing interest rates, so they can pay pack the loans with interest. This gives a monumental sort of ‘computational boost’ to society, as saved wealth is accumulated and placed under the control of minds or CPUs that have good ideas. Without finance and banking entrepreneurs would have a much much harder time obtaining the necessary wealth needed to implement their superior ideas thus greatly slowing down the rate at which the social order continuously grows and morphs itself in more productive and technologically advanced way. Unfortunately people through the ages do not understand this and tend to see people getting rich without physical labor by just lending money as somewhat immoral or unfair.

Islam has strong prohibitions against charging interest(usury) which have hampered the economy’s evolution in the Islamic world. The Qur’an mentions:

“Those who devour usury will not stand except as stands one whom the Evil One by his touch has driven to madness. That is because they say: “Trade is like usury,” but Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury…”

Christianity’s New Testament seems more usury-friendly via passages like, Luke 19:23 “Why, then, didst thou not put money in a bank, so that I on my return might have gotten it with interest?” , but Luke 6:35 “But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back” could be used to support an anti-usury position which is what the Church enforced for over a thousand years before eventually abandoning the strong anti-usury stand.

When it comes to Judaism and the Old Testament, God’s message is one that shuns charging interest between Israelites-Jews but allows it to be charged to non-Israelites. The most influential verses are Deuteronomy 23:20 “You may charge a foreigner interest, but not a brother Israelite…” and Exodus 22:25 “If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not be like a moneylender; charge him no interest.”

These scriptures have had profound inadvertent ramifications. In a Christian world that would excommunicate usurers-moneylenders, Jews being immune to excommunication and now without Christian competition found an advantage as moneylenders-bankers. Historian Paul Johnson writes:

“The Jews reacted by engaging in the one business where Christian laws actually discriminated in their favour, and so became identified with the hated trade of moneylending. Rabbi Joseph Colon, who knew both France and Italy in the second half of the fifteenth century, wrote that the Jews of both countries hardly engaged in any other profession”

Johnson mentions other ways in which Jews helped push the world in a more capitalist direction. One was financial innovation via their influence in the development of stock markets. Another was their stress on the importance of advertising. Better advertising speeds up competition and its spread of superior ideas-products so it is a great boost to civilization-order. The September 27th 1712 issue of England’s Spectator described the Jew’s vital influence as follows:

“They are so disseminated through all the trading Parts of the World, that they are become the instruments by which the most distant Nations converse with one another and by which mankind are knit together in a general correspondence. They are like the pegs and nails in a great building, which though they are but little valued in themselves, are absolutely necessary to keep the whole frame together.”

It was bad enough that they rejected the divinity of Christianity and Islam and practiced usury; but Jews were also fierce competitors who would upset Christian businessmen by disrupting their anti-competitive customs, all for the great benefit of the consumer and European social order and culture of course. Unfortunately, economic ignorance would lead many to understandably hate Jews and their understandable yet, very important!, inadvertent over-representation in business-Capitalism. Mises writes:

“The Nazis have an ally in every town or village where there is a man eager to get rid of a Jewish competitor. The secret weapon of Hitler is the anti-Jewish inclinations of many millions of shopkeepers and grocers, of doctors and lawyers, professors and writers.”

Hitler, who like most popular leaders was simply the embodiment of the economic fallacies-myths-prejudices of the times, was of course a ‘National Socialist’, who had little understanding of the vital role that economic freedom and emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ plays in society and erroneously saw things like the emerging stock markets and finance industry, especially given the relative over-representation of Jews, as some gimmick-scam plotted by them to the detriment of non-Jews. His fallacies-ignorance can easily be seen in excerpts like this one from a speech given in Munich on July 28th, 1922:

“The vast process of the industrialization of the peoples meant the confluence of great masses of workmen in the towns…Parallel with this was a gradual ‘moneyfication’ of the whole of the nation’s labor-strength. ‘Share-capital’ was in the ascendant, and thus bit by bit the Stock Exchange came to control the whole national economy. The directors of these institutions were, and are without exception, Jews. I say ‘without exception,’ for the few non-Jews who had a share in them are in the last resort nothing but screens, shop-window Christians, whom one needs in order, for the sake of the masses, to keep up the appearance that these institutions were after all founded as a natural outcome of the needs and the economic life of all peoples alike, and were not, as was the fact, institutions which correspond only with the essential characteristics of the Jewish people and are the outcome of those characteristics.”

Next, let us also briefly discuss some of the environmental-’evolutionary factors’-pressures which unfortunately attracted so many Jews to Socialism-Communism with disastrous repercussions. How prevalent were Jews in spreading-implementing Socialist-Communist ideology? First of all there was Karl Marx, Socialism-Communism’s main intellectual who gave the movement enough of a naïve intellectual aura to mislead hundreds of future would-be dictators-intellectuals. Leon Trotsky(born Lev Davidovich Bronstein), founder of the Red Army, second only to Lenin and most likely to succeed him as leader of the Russian communists was also an ethnic Jew. Slezkine writes:

“At the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets in June 1917, at least 31 percent of Bolshevik delegates(and 37 percent of Unified Social Democrats) were Jews. At the Bolshevik Central Committee meeting of October 23, 1917, which voted to launch an armed insurrection, 5 out of the 12 members present were Jews. Three out of seven Politbureau members charged with leading the October uprising were Jews(Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Grigory Sokolnikov).”

According to Lenin, it was thanks to Jews that his Bolsheviks were able to “take over the state apparatus” in Russia. Lenin mentions:

“The fact that there were many Jewish intelligentsia members in the Russian cities was of great importance to the revolution. They put an end to the general sabotage that we were confronted with after the October Revolution… The Jewish elements were mobilized… and thus saved the revolution at a difficult time. It was only thanks to this pool of a rational and literate labor force that we succeeded in taking over the state apparatus”

For a people who were sometimes seen as foreigners, Socialism’s international brotherhood (“Workers of the world, unite!” was to be a popular rallying cry) would seem to have an additional appeal and be a perfect fit for a people who were already a sort of international family. Socialism’s atheism would also do away with a major source of Jewish troubles now that everyone was supposed to be atheist-irreligious in the new scientific and rational Socialist world. The central and viral economic fallacy of Socialism, that having smart people-”experts” plan the social order would be better than letting selfish and greedy businessmen do so, needed the smarter and better educated to be the planners, and this is exactly what Jews were compared to the rest (at least in Russia), thus naturally and inadvertently rising to the top of the movement. As Chaim Weizmann recalls in his autobiography: “the non-Jewish population had not the same overwhelming thirst for knowledge as the Jews, who were always knocking at the doors of the schools.”

This large participation-association of ethnic Jews with Socialism would have disastrous consequences for the majority of Jews who did not want to be a part of Socialism or much less abandon their faith and traditions. As Lenin and Trotsky were launching post-World War One Russia into a civil war(1918–22) between the Communist Red Army and the White Russian Army which supported the Russian Monarchy and old order-institutions, Jews would pay a heavy price. Johnson writes that:

“The consequences for the Jews both immediate and long-term, both locally and world-wide, were appalling. The White Russian armies, seeking to destroy the Soviet regime, treated all Jews as enemies. In the Ukraine, the Civil War developed into the most extensive pogrom in Jewish history… In other parts of eastern Europe, a similar identification of Jews with Bolshevism led directly to murderous attacks on harmless Jewish communities. They were particularly bloody in Poland after the failure of the Bolshevik invasion and in Hungary after the fall of the Bela Kun regime. They occurred intermittently in Rumania throughout the 1920s. In all three countries the local Communist Parties had been largely created and run by Non-Jewish Jews, and in each case it was the unpolitical, traditional, observant Jews of the ghettos and villages who paid the penalty.”

Again, it needs to be stressed, as Johnson just mentioned: “In all three countries the local Communist Parties had been largely created and run by Non-Jewish Jews”. Thus it is quite understandable how so many like Hitler, Churchill and many Europeans came to associate-equate Jews with it.

We are now in a position to fully appreciate the wisdom of the founder of the misguided ideology of political Zionism and the eventual creation of Israel, Theodor Herzl when he writes:

“We are what the Ghetto made us. We have attained pre-eminence in finance, because mediaeval conditions drove us to it. The same process is now being repeated. We are again being forced into finance, now it is the stock exchange, by being kept out of other branches of economic activity. Being on the stock exchange, we are consequently exposed afresh to contempt. At the same time we continue to produce an abundance of mediocre intellects who find no outlet, and this endangers our social position as much as does our increasing wealth. Educated Jews without means are now rapidly becoming Socialists. Hence we are certain to suffer very severely in the struggle between classes, because we stand in the most exposed position in the camps of both Socialists and capitalists.”

We must emphasize that Socialist-Communist ideology, rooted on easy to absorb economic fallacies, was already spreading throughout the world and can be seen as an almost inevitable mistake as mankind tried to make sense of the workings of the social order-economy which was quickly growing in bewildering complexity. Jews were inadvertently in a position to be more attracted to Socialism and Capitalism and be leaders in both. They obviously did not “invent” or “plot” Socialism-Communism-Capitalism like Hitler and many others to this day claim. It could be said that they were ‘naturally selected’ to be Socialist-Capitalist-finance leaders, thus giving the impression to naïve thinkers that they were its “creators-plotters”.

The over-representation and influence of Jews in Media and Hollywood which Kanye West and others lament is also an understandable inadvertent outgrowth of the above factors. By being more likely to be atheists and thus freer from traditional religion-influenced morals, and also better educated which goes hand-in-hand with a Darwinian-evolutionary outlook which is more tolerant and permissive of human nature, Jews once again found themselves leaders in the carnal pleasures associated with Hollywood, pornography, and the music industry. As Marlon Brando put it: “Hollywood is run by Jews. It’s owned by Jews”…Totally understandable and NOT part of some self-serving malicious plotters. Jewish involvement and influence in such movements-industries is “indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.” If “the Jews” were smart enough to “plot” the numerous things the non-Jewish world accuses them of, they would have been smart enough to realize that Socialism-Communism was a disaster for Jew and non-Jew alike and have been telling everyone about fellow Jew Ludwig von Mises and have built him a 20+ feet solid gold statue and placed it in front of the Western Wall. The fact that they have yet to do this is further evidence that Jews in general are as lost in ignorance and mythology as the rest which makes perfect sense when one realizes that Jews, Muslims, Christians, Russians, Americans, etc. are just fellow homo sapiens who grow up in a particular place-time and absorb a Jewish-Muslim-Christian “identity”-software-myths.

Next we want to identify, understand, and help overcome a repeating pattern that once again threatens to destroy civilization via the Russia-Ukraine war. Some homo sapiens make numerous errors leading to antisemitism, which then leads Jews and sympathetic supporters, lacking the proper understanding of the root causes of antisemitism, to treat the antisemites, not as misguided homo sapiens, but as some “evil” people to be silenced, made criminals out of (for allegedly ‘spreading hate’), or destroyed via disastrous world wars as with Hitler’s Germany and WWII. Jews, oftentimes with immense and admirable patience, do try to educate the antisemites, but they do so by showing them the history of Jewish suffering instead of getting to the root socioeconomic fallacies mentioned above since they are unaware of them, so the fallacies and resulting antisemitism and related chaos continues.

Take for example Zionism, the idea that Jews should live in their own country. Both antisemitism and Zionism are rooted in the same intellectual error, that the homo sapiens who “identify as Jews” are so different from the other homo sapiens that they must leave the real thousands of towns and Synagogues where for hundreds of years they were an integral part of Western Civilization to create a country based on religious mythology in an area already populated by others who had a different “identity” (Muslims, Christians, and fellow anti-Zionist Jews) and for numerous understandable reasons were adamantly opposed to the creation of a “Jewish State” in their surroundings. Theodore Herzl himself highlighted this ideological congruence of both Zionists and antisemites in his foundational book “The Jewish State”(1896):

“The anti-semites will be our most steadfast friends.” “The anti-Semitic countries will be our allies” “Great exertions will hardly be necessary to spur on the movement. Anti-Semites provide the requisite impetus. They need only do what they did before, and then they will create a desire to emigrate where it did not previously exist, and strengthen it where it existed before.”

We already mentioned how freedom and the competition that grows from it was shaping the relatively “ethnocentric” identities of all peoples and turning us into worldly citizens. During the early days of political Zionism most Jews understandably thought it was a bad idea. The rabbinical establishment in Munich, Germany, where Herzl wanted to hold the First Zionist Congress, strongly rejected the idea so the meeting was moved to Basle Switzerland(8/29–31/1897). They told him :

“Regarding nationality, we feel totally at one with our fellow Germans and therefore strive towards the realization of the spiritual and moral goals of our dear fatherland with an enthusiasm equaling theirs”

Many Jews were divided into the Zionists and anti-Zionists (“assimilationists”). Chaim Weizmann, the leading Zionist figure after Herzl’s death in 1904, lamented how “assimilated Jews” were “dead against Zionism” and identified Zionism (correctly IMHO) as “a primitive tribalism”:

“For assimilated Jews…They looked upon it…as a primitive tribalism. They felt themselves…called upon to “rescue” Judaism from Zionism…these people are dead against Zionism…Zionism is not meant for those people who have cut themselves adrift from Jewry…”

Of course! That rapidly increasing number of very well educated less-religious cosmopolitan “assimilated Jews” spread all over Europe-USA just wanted to be fellow human beings or equal world citizens free of ancient tribalisms-mysticisms-identities. Unfortunately, for very understandable reasons-factors for which nobody is to blame, like a rocket that is just about to reach orbit but runs out of fuel and comes crashing down to earth, Zionism would inadvertently pull Jews and all of Western Civilization back to an increasingly ethnocentric identity-worldview with disastrous consequences. The Zionist Jews began to tie their “identity” to a massive error and eventually reach the stage where we are today, where saying that Zionism and the Israeli state as it currently functions has been a massive error, essentially what most Jews in the late 1800s were wisely saying, is seen by many Jews today as antisemitic, and thus even as ‘hate speech’ which threatens to destroy the vital freedom of speech needed to properly discuss and overturn errors and myths.

Next let’s briefly look at WWII. It is widely understood that the Treaty of Versailles forced upon the losing Germans after World War One had countless injustices, one of them being separating the German city of Danzig from the mainland by making it an enclave within, and largely controlled by, Poland. Most historians today and wise politicians during the lead-up to World War Two felt like Hitler’s demands that Danzig should be reunited with Germany were very reasonable and legitimate goals. For example, former US President Herbert Hoover criticized the Roosevelt Administration’s virulent anti-Hitler stance when he wrote:

“Another action by Mr. Roosevelt was his influence upon the Poles not to negotiate the question of Danzig. The adamant attitude of the Poles against negotiations received support from the Washington Administration. The separation of the German city of Danzig from Germany…had long been a cause of agitation by the Germans. Both were a part of vengeance and there was merit in the German claims. I had stated at one time that they should be corrected.”

Why such defiance to Hitler’s reasonable demands? Because Hitler’s crass antisemitism, statements like “Don’t think you can fight racial tuberculosis without taking care to rid the nation of the carrier of that racial tuberculosis. This Jewish contamination will not subside”, the 1935 racist and antisemitic Nuremberg Laws, and the government sanctioned cruelty of events like Kristallnacht (November 9–10, 1938) where thousands of Jewish properties were vandalized, understandably led Jews and their civilized sympathetic supporters in the US and British governments to mistakenly see Hitler and Nazi Germany as an even more barbaric place than Stalin’s Soviet Union, and eventually unwilling to compromise on what were very reasonable demands that would have avoided the WWII slaughter. Consider the following. Over 5 years before the Second World War broke out on Sept 1st, 1939, on January, 1934 Vladimir Jabotinsky, one of the most popular an influential Jews of the 20th century preached:

“For months now the struggle against Germany is waged by each Jewish community, at each conference, in all our syndicates, and by each Jew all over the world. There is reason to believe that our part in this struggle has general value. We will trigger a spiritual and material war of all the world against Germany’s ambitions to become once again a great nation, to recover lost territories and colonies. But our Jewish interests demand the complete destruction of Germany. Collectively and individually, the German nation is a threat to us Jews.”

These sorts of quasi-religious statements full of fatalistic language, and maniacal and simplistic good vs. evil characterizations-ideology frequently blasted on leading newspapers in the USA and England for about 6 years, and their influence on sympathetic politicians, especially the already fiercely anti-German Roosevelt administration (Roosevelt had been Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Navy during World War One), coupled with the understandable increasing antisemitism in Germany would play the leading role in getting large groups of fellow homo sapiens to needlessly slaughter each other. Communism, just like antisemitism, is the result of numerous intellectual errors. Labeling Communists as “evil” or crazy or psychopaths is NOT what led to its relative demise. It was Menger and his intellectual descendants of the so-called ‘Austrian School’ like Mises and Hayek who managed to help enough people overcome the fallacies which led to the Communist tyrannies(summary of how they did this here). Similarly, simply labeling misguided “antisemites” as evil or irrational is NOT what will end antisemitism and emerging polarizations and wars. We need both Jews and misguided antisemites to overcome the fallacies and abandon tribalistic vilifications.

Man’s current inability to properly understand the evolution of Jew-Gentile frictions-misunderstandings and resulting polarizations threatens to once again lead to what may surely be homo sapiens Final War via the Russia-Ukriane war. Although Putin and his government are nowhere near as ‘antisemitic’ as Hiter’s was, Putin’s government gets along very well with strong critics of Israel and Zionism like Syria and Iran. Keeping with long established United Nations traditions going back to 1949 Russia recognizes territory in northern Israel referred to as the ‘Golan Heights’ as belonging to Syria, not Israel. The most important Palestinian leader, President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, considers Russia to be a fairer and more impartial collaborator for peace than the USA. He told Putin:

“We don’t trust America…We don’t trust it, we don’t rely on it, and under no circumstances can we accept that America is the sole party in resolving a problem,”…”Russia stands by justice and international law and that is enough for us,”….”we are happy and satisfied with the Russian position.”

Besides a nearly incapacitated and clearly senile US President Biden, arguably the most powerful US politician, especially as it relates to war and foreign policy, is the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken who is Jewish and understandably sees Iran and Syria as some of the most sinister-evil countries in the world given their attitude towards Israel-Zionism and clearly antisemmitic views of many of their leaders. For example, on July 27, 2022, Iran’s Supreme Ruler Ali Khamenei tweeted the following:

“The Western powers are a mafia. The reality of this power is a mafia. At the top of this mafia stand the prominent Zionist merchants, and the politicians obey them. The US is their showcase, and they’re spread out everywhere.”

Again, mistaking the immense influence of pro-Zionism Jews which is the result of complex evolutionary factors, for some inexistent sinister conspiracy. Further complicating matters is the fact that Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish. Zelenskyy told Israeli politicians in a Zoom meeting “You can mediate between countries, but not between good and evil.” Again, the inevitable emergence of the simplistic-tribalistic ‘good and evil’ mythical thinking you need for large groups of homo sapiens to slaughter each other. Zelensky is also trying to portray the good relations between Russia and Iran leading to Russians helping Iran acquire nuclear weapons. He mentioned: “Is Iran just interested in money? Probably not money at all, but Russian assistance to the Iranian nuclear program Probably, this is exactly the meaning of their alliance.”


The above factors and image with three consecutive tweets from Khamenei understandably cause Jews and their sympathetic supporters in the USA and Europe to create an intellectual aura that paints Russia-Putin, as, you guessed it, the next irrational maniacal Hitler, and radiate a naïve “good vs. evil” mentality that can only lead to World War as happened in World War Two. Bottom line, the patterns are just repeating. Hitler miscalculated how his antisemitism would turn the US, England, and other major powers against him regardless of his very reasonable proposals for Danzig reunification, especially once he felt he had no choice but to reunite Danzig by force by invading Poland. Putin, just like Hitler, felt he needed to use force-invasion to bring independence or reunification to many ethnic Russians who were stuck living under a Ukrainian government they despised. Putin miscalculated how his support for critics of Zionism-Israel like Syria, Iran, Abbas, etc. would likewise turn Jews and once again the USA and other major powers against his very reasonable desire to somehow bring independence or non-Ukrainian rule to ethnic Russians living in Eastern Ukraine. Both Hitler and Putin were-are fellow homo sapiens, both actually very experienced and in many ways astute and accomplished world leaders, yet both found themselves portrayed as some irrational evil monsters due to disastrous antisemitism as in the case of Hitler, or having friendly relations with countries and intellectuals that are very critical of Israel and Zionism to various degrees, and also make misguided antisemitic statements which makes it very easy for Jews and their supporters to then ignore, vilify, bomb them.

We must emphasize that antisemitism and resulting Zionist ‘identity’ and all that grows from them are just intellectual errors, understandably committed by very bright and oftentimes admirable people based on prevailing ideas and what are essentially myths. Catholic-religious oppression was implemented by bright and pious people, the same applies to Communism, as well as the recent CovidMania and the countless doctors and medical professionals that went along with lockdowns and coerced bullshit vaccinations. Hayek’s wisdom bellow applies to all of these self-mutilating calamities which are ultimately “indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.” Hayek writes:

“Most people are still unwilling to face the most alarming lesson of modern history: that the greatest crimes of our time have been committed by governments that had the enthusiastic support of millions of people who were guided by moral impulses. It is simply not true that Hitler or Mussolini, Lenin or Stalin, appealed only to the worst instincts of their people: they also appealed to some of the feelings which also dominate contemporary democracies.”

From a very simple and obvious evolutionary perspective, there is no such thing as “evil”, only homo sapiens, the intuitive tribalistic-violent instincts he has inherited, and the above-explained economic ignorance which must always lead them to some sort of coercion to manage the social order and kill the evildoers-antisemites-‘conspiratorial jews’-etc. All physical threats and acts of coercion are ultimately rooted in economic ignorance and must be understood as such.
